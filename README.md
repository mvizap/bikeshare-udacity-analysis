# bikeshare-udacity-analysis

This the first project of the Data Analysis Nanodregree at Udacity. In this project, I used  Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I imported the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics.
